This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Object-Oriented Programming in Python 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/getting-started-object-oriented-programming-python-3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788629744), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The world is filled with coders, who write pieces of programs in a bid to find solutions to various problems. In such a field where the competition is already intense, you need a definitive edge over the rest. One of the better ways to stay ahead of the pack is to write smarter code. Writing large programs can be painful. That’s where Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes to the rescue. OOP saves a considerable amount of coding man-hours in the long run by writing code in a smarter way, through various techniques. 
You’ll begin with building objects and classes, followed by developing Constructors and Destructors to call and kill the objects. Next, you’ll get a detailed understanding of Inheritance and its dependence on objects. Based on their data types, you’ll learn to process objects differently through Polymorphism, while Abstraction techniques will enable you to hide data from a user. To ensure efficient coding, you will be introduced to Exceptions and Error Handling. Furthermore, Encapsulation with methods and variables will help you to keep data safe from external, unwanted interference. In the final sections, you will be taken through recursion mechanisms.
By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with the OOP techniques in Python 3, which will help you to write codes better and in an efficient manner.
